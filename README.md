# Detecting-Endangered-Species-from-Camera-Trap

As time has passed, various factors like the growth of industries, a rise in population, people spreading out (leading to habitat loss), impacts of climate, and environmental
pollution have placed numerous living species at risk of
extinction. Recognizing the vital role that these species play
in maintaining the natural balance, the looming threat of
extinction poses significant challenges for the future. Seeking solutions to address this issue, our study focuses on
developing models capable of detecting both near to extinct
and endangered species. Employing mostly straightforward
approaches, we crafted Categorical Naive Bayes model,
utilizing a dataset comprising 35,641 camera trap images
across 10 classes, sourced from different datasets. Through
this research, we aim to contribute practical insights towards
the conservation of diverse life forms in the face of ongoing
environmental challenges. Also, CNN implementation is on process.
